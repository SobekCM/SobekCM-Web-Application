To setup the event log source, use the following, with elevated access as ADMIN


eventcreate /ID 1 /L APPLICATION /T INFORMATION  /SO MYEVENTSOURCE /D "Establishing source during installation"

Event log source restrictions:
   21 characters or shorter
   Cannot be hierarchical ( no / or \ )
   Must not be already used  ( HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/EventLog/Application)

Make sure to check that the source does not exist before calling CreateEventSource, otherwise it will throw an exception.

EventSourceCreationData sourceData = new EventSourceCreationData("MyApp1", "Application");
		sourceData.MachineName = "myserver";
		if (!System.Diagnostics.EventLog.SourceExists("MyApp1", "myserver"))
			System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource(sourceData);

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   SYSTEM
      CurrentControlSet
         Services
            EventLog
               Application
                  AppName
               Security
               System
                  DriverName
               CustomLog

-----------------------------------

Copy the solr files over (save the old CORES!!) from the ZIP file.

And.. that is it!

-----------------------------------

Don't need to "mount" the core or anything.. just copy over.

-----------------------------------

Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly ( to c:\Program Files\Java\jdk**)
Also had to add java/jdk/bin to the path

This is what worked for me:

* Close the installer when you see Java error 1603

* Open javacpl.exe from C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_31\bin

* Uncheck Enable Java content in browser on security tab and click OK to close Java control panel

* Retry installing Java. Mine succeeded this time.

* Open javacpl.exe from C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_31\bin

* Check Enable Java content in browser on security tab and click OK to close Java control panel
