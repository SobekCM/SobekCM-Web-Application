  <h1>Map Search FAQ</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>How do I search?</strong>
      <p class="tagline">To perform a search, you first need to define your area or point of interest and then perform the search. There are several ways to define your area of interest. You can either enter an address to search or you can draw either a region or point on the map. Once you have defined your search, click the <i>Search</i> button to discover any matches to that location.</p>
      <p class="tagline">To search for addresses, type in an address and click on the <i>Find Address</i> button. You may also use major landmark names, although addresses may work better. Be sure to include the city and state in your search as well. Once the address is located on the map, click <i>Search</i> to discover resources which include that location. </p>
      <p class="tagline">To search by map, click either <i>Press to Select Area</i> or <i>Press to Select Point</i> on the map. When using Select Area, click on a starting point on the map and then click on the opposite corner to create a rectangle. By clicking on <i>Search</i> above the map, you will retrieve matches for that area. With Select Point, choose a specific location and click on <i>Search</i>.</p>

    <li><strong>I am having difficulty selecting an area</strong>
      <p class="tagline">Selecting a rectangular area to search is simple once you understand the technique.  First, select the <i>Press to Select Area</i> button on the map.  Then, move to the top left corner of the region you wish to search and click and release the left mouse button.  As you move the mouse now you will notice a rectangle is being drawn which represents your region.  When you click and release the mouse again, you define the lower right corner of the region to search.  Do not press the mouse button and drag the mouse, as this will drag the map around, and will not define a region to select.  Once your region is correctly identified, press the <i>Search</i> button to view matching results.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>I am having difficulty searching by address</strong>
      <p class="tagline">Be sure to enter the complete address, including state and country.  You can also try to use the name of a major landmark, but using an address often works better.  Once you enter the address or major landmark name, press the <i>Find Address</i> button.  Look at the map and verify that the location found on the map matches your desired search.  Then, press the <i>Search</i> button to view matching results.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What is being searched?</strong>
      <p class="tagline">The data searched depends upon the material type. For newspapers, the place of publication is searched. For maps, the geographic coverage is searched. And for photographs, the location the photograph was taken is searched.</p>

    <li><strong>Why so few hits?</strong>
      <p class="tagline"> This interface is in beta testing, as we add more coordinate information to our database to search. Check back often to see our progress! </p>
